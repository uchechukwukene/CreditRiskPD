## Project Overview
**CreditRiskPD** is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict the probability of default (PD) for credit risk management. This repository provides a modular and well-documented pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Financial institutions and analysts can leverage this tool to make informed, data-driven decisions in credit risk assessment, improving risk management and reducing financial losses.
